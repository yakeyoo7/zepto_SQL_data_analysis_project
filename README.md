# zepto_SQL_data_analysis_project

"SQL E-Commerce Data Analysis"  A data analysis project that explores an e-commerce dataset using SQL to uncover actionable business insights. This project focuses on querying, cleaning, and transforming raw data to answer real-world questions about sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and revenue growth. 
Key features:
>Structured database design and data cleaning
>Advanced SQL queries (JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, window functions)
>Sales and revenue analysis by time, category, and region
>Customer segmentation and retention insights
>Top-performing products and categories
>Business-driven KPIs and metrics

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical SQL skills for data analysis and show how raw transactional data can be turned into meaningful insights for decision-making in an e-commerce environment.

## 🗂 Dataset Overview

The dataset represents a typical e-commerce system and includes tables such as:

- `customers` – customer details and locations  
- `orders` – order-level information and timestamps  
- `order_items` – products within each order  
- `products` – product names, categories, and prices  
- `payments` – payment types and amounts  

*(Table names may vary depending on your implementation.)*

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)  
- Any SQL client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)  
- CSV files or database dump  
---

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- Total revenue and monthly sales trends  
- Top-selling products and categories  
- Customer lifetime value (CLV)  
- Repeat vs. one-time customers  
- Average order value (AOV)  
- Sales by region  
- Payment method distribution  

Advanced SQL techniques used:
- `JOIN` operations  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Subqueries  
- Window functions  
- Aggregations and grouping  
- Date/time analysis
